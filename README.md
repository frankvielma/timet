# Timet

![Timet](timet.webp)

Timet refers to a command-line tool designed to track your activities by recording the time spent on each task, allowing you to monitor your work hours and productivity directly from your terminal without needing a graphical interface; essentially, it's a way to log your time spent on different projects or tasks using simple text commands

**Key Features:**

- **Local Data Storage:** Timet utilizes SQLite to store your time tracking data locally, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Its efficient design and local data storage make Timet a speedy and responsive tool.
- **Structured Data:** SQLite ensures your data is organized and easily accessible.
- **Scalability:** Timet can handle growing time tracking needs.
- **Data Integrity:** SQLite maintains the accuracy and consistency of your data.
- **Querying and Reporting:** Generate detailed reports for specific periods.
- **CSV Export:** Easily export your time tracking data to CSV format for further analysis or sharing.
- **Pomodoro Integration:** The pomodoro option in the start command enhances time tracking by integrating the Pomodoro Technique.
- **Block Time Plot:** Visualizes the distribution of tracked time across a specified range of dates, with bars in each column representing the amount of time tracked during that specific hour. The plot includes a header showing the hours and a row for each date, displaying the time blocks for each hour.
- **Tag Distribution Plot:** Illustrates the proportion of total tracked time allocated to each tag, showing the relative contribution of each tag to the overall time tracked.

Example:

```bash

---
- **timet start [tag] --notes="" --pomodoro=[minutes]**: Starts tracking time for a task labeled with the provided [tag],  notes and "pomodoro time" in minutes (optional). Example:

  ```bash
  timet start task1 --notes="Meeting with client" --pomodoro=25

  or

  tt start task1 "Meeting with client" 25

  Tracked time report [today]:
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  | Id    | Date       | Tag    | Start    | End      | Duration | Notes                    |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  |     1 | 2024-08-09 | task1  | 14:55:07 |        - | 00:00:00 | Meeting with client      |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  |                                           Total:  | 00:00:00 |                          |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  ```

  This command will initiate a 25-minute Pomodoro session for the task "task1" with the provided description.

  ### Pomodoro Integration

  The `pomodoro` option in the `start` command enhances time tracking by integrating the Pomodoro Technique. Users can specify a Pomodoro session length in minutes, like `pomodoro=25`, to start a 25-minute work interval. The app automatically tracks time and notifies users when the interval ends, helping maintain focus.

  **Benefits**

    - **Flexibility**: Supports various productivity strategies.
    - **Focus**: Encourages disciplined work practices.
    - **Productivity**: Helps achieve higher productivity and better time management.

---

- **timet stop**: Stops tracking the current task, records the elapsed time, and displays the total time spent on all tasks.

  ```bash
  timet stop
  ```

  ```
