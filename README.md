[Timet](https://rubygems.org/gems/timet) is a command-line tool designed to track your activities by recording the time spent on each task. This tool allows you to monitor your work hours and productivity directly from your terminal, eliminating the need for a graphical interface. Essentially, it's a way to log your time spent on different projects or tasks using simple text commands.

<h2 id="key-features">üîë Key Features:</h2>

- **Local Data Storage:** Timet uses SQLite to store your time tracking data locally, ensuring privacy and security.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Its efficient design and local data storage make Timet a speedy and responsive tool.
- **Structured Data:** SQLite ensures your data is organized and easily accessible.
- **Scalability:** Timet can handle growing time tracking needs.
- **Data Integrity:** SQLite maintains the accuracy and consistency of your data.
- **Querying and Reporting:** Generate detailed reports for specific periods.
- **CSV Export:** Easily export your time tracking data to CSV format for further analysis or sharing.
- **Pomodoro Integration:** The `pomodoro` option in the `start` command enhances time tracking by integrating the Pomodoro Technique.
- **Block Time Plot:** Visualizes the distribution of tracked time across a specified range of dates. Each column represents the amount of time tracked during a specific hour, with a header showing the hours and a row for each date displaying the time blocks for each hour.
- **Tag Distribution Plot:** Illustrates the proportion of total tracked time allocated to each tag, showing the relative contribution of each tag to the overall time tracked.
- **Detailed Statistics:** Displays detailed statistics for each tag, including total duration, average duration, and standard deviation.
- **iCalendar Export:** Easily export your time tracking data to iCalendar format for integration with calendar applications.
- **S3 Cloud Backup:** Seamlessly backup and sync your time tracking data with S3-compatible storage services, providing an additional layer of data protection and accessibility.

<a name="usage"></a>
## ‚è≥ Usage

### Command Aliases

- `timet`: The primary command for interacting with the Timet application.
- `tt`: An alias for the `timet` command, providing a shorter alternative.

---

- **`timet start [tag] --notes="" --pomodoro=[minutes]`:** Starts tracking time for a task labeled with the provided [tag], notes, and "pomodoro time" in minutes (optional). Example:

  ```bash
  timet start task1 --notes="Meeting with client" --pomodoro=25

  or

  tt start task1 "Meeting with client" 25
  ```

  ```
  Tracked time report [today]:
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  | Id    | Date       | Tag    | Start    | End      | Duration | Notes                    |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  |     1 | 2024-08-09 | task1  | 14:55:07 |        - | 00:00:00 | Meeting with client      |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  |                                           Total:  | 00:00:00 |                          |
  +-------+------------+--------+----------+----------+----------+--------------------------+
  ```

  This command will initiate a 25-minute Pomodoro session for the task "task1" with the provided description.

  ### Pomodoro Integration

  The `pomodoro` option in the `start` command enhances time tracking by integrating the Pomodoro Technique. Users can specify a Pomodoro session length in minutes, like `pomodoro=25`, to start a 25-minute work interval. The app automatically tracks time and notifies users when the interval ends, helping maintain focus.

  **Benefits:**

  - **Flexibility:** Supports various productivity strategies.
  - **Focus:** Encourages disciplined work practices.
  - **Productivity:** Helps achieve higher productivity and better time management.

---

- **`timet stop`:** Stops tracking the current task, records the elapsed time, and displays the total time spent on all tasks.

  ```bash
  timet stop
  ```

  ```

### Date Range in Summary

The `timet summary` command now supports specifying a date range for generating reports. This allows users to filter and summarize data within specific date intervals. The date format is in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

#### Examples:

- **Single Date:** Display a report for a specific date.

  ```sh
  timet su 2024-01-03
  ```

- **Date Range:** Display a report for a date range.

  ```sh
  timet su 2024-01-02..2024-01-03
  ```

## üóÉÔ∏è Data

Timet's data is stored in `~/.timet`.

<a name="s3-cloud-backup-configuration"></a>
## üîí S3 Cloud Backup Configuration

Timet supports backing up and syncing your time tracking data with S3-compatible storage services (such as Supabase S3). To configure S3 backup, follow these steps:

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (`~/.timet`) with the following variables:

```bash
S3_ENDPOINT=your_s3_endpoint_url
S3_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
S3_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
S3_REGION=your_s3_region
```

### Security Considerations

- Keep your `.env` file private and never commit it to version control
- Use strong, unique access keys
- Regularly rotate your S3 access credentials
- Implement appropriate IAM policies to restrict bucket access



## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
